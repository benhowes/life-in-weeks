Hi, I'm [Ben](https://ben-howes.co.uk). This is a map of my life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. Tap a box to see what I was doing where that week.

📍 Read more about [Life in Weeks at Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). I customised the code by adapting [Gina Trapani's version of this](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks), which was in turn from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks).

🌱 This life and this map are a work in progress. I'll update it as I go.
